# ‚ú® The Aurora Project: Series 1 - JAX Sharding Architect ‚ú®

**Unlock the secrets of data distribution in JAX and command colossal AI models with surgical precision!** üöÄ

This first series of "The Aurora Project" is your masterclass in JAX sharding. We're not just moving data; we're designing the very blueprints for how monumental AI systems perceive and process information across distributed hardware. If you're ready to go beyond basic JAX and master how to make your data flow efficiently at scale on a single host, you're in the right place.

## üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Forge:

* **Master Memory & Devices:** Command `jax.DeviceArray`, explicit memory placement (`device_put`, `device_get`), and understand data transfer costs.
* **Conquer with `pmap`:** Lay the foundations of data parallelism on a single host.
* **Design Device Topologies:** Wield `jax.sharding.Mesh` to abstract hardware into logical, multi-dimensional grids.
* **Master Explicit Sharding (`jax.sharding`):**
    * Blueprint with `PartitionSpec` (`P`) for logical layouts.
    * Materialize sharded `jax.Array`s with `NamedSharding`, understanding "sharding in types."
    * Decode sharding propagation rules and compiler (GSPMD) interactions.
    * Take full control with `shard_map` for explicit SPMD programming.
    * Level up with advanced techniques like mixed sharding modes (`auto_axes`, `explicit_axes`) and conceptualize FSDP/Tensor Parallelism layouts.
 * **Details about shard map and collectives**

## üó∫Ô∏è Your Architectural Journey (Chapters):

1.  **1.1: Data Primitives** - Arrays, Devices & Explicit Memory Management.
2.  **1.2: `pmap`** - Foundations of Data Parallelism.
3.  **1.3: Device `Mesh`** - Abstracting Hardware Topology for Advanced Sharding.
4.  **Mastering Explicit Sharding with `jax.sharding`**
    * Defining Blueprints (`PartitionSpec`).
    * Applying Blueprints (`NamedSharding`, Sharded `jax.Array` Types, "Sharding-in-Types").
    * Sharding Propagation Rules & GSPMD Compiler Integration.
    * `shard_map`: Explicit Per-Device Programming.
    * Advanced Sharding Techniques & Mixed Modes.
5.  **Details about `shard_map` and how to use various collectives.**

## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ For Aurora's Elite:

This series is designed for **pro-level learners** already comfortable with machine learning fundamentals and basic JAX concepts. We dive deep, and we move fast.
